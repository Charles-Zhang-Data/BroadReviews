# git-wiki

Per https://github.com/Drassil/git-wiki-theme.

Don't use moving forward.

## Reviews

* Nice out-of-box features, but like everything, it's limiting.
* Navigation is impossible to use. Generated table of contents is very ugly.
* SideBar is impossible to use and configurations are not feature complete.

## TODO

At the moment we had P9 wiki under it. Sooner or latter we need to build our own from ground up.
