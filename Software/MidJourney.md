# Midjourney

This is becoming more serious. More dedicated notes available (privately, in terms application) in P9 CG and (publically, on technical aspects) MyML.

## MidJourney 2022 (I)

Haven't tried DALLÂ·E 2, but without question MidJourney is the best among other available platforms. The next candiate is Stable/Disco Diffusion.

After experimenting with AI for a few days, there is one thing I really don't understand.

You might want to cover your eyes if you have a soft heart for the remaining of these:

<img alt="Midjourney Woman Default Ugliness 3" max-height="256" src="https://images.totalimagine.com/Midjourney/20221224_default_ugliness_3.jpg"/>

Why, without further modification, that the AI's first generation of human (female) faces always have some kind of blood and stuff?

Saw today the news Nutcracker team used Midjourney generated image for ads. What if Midjourney was free, or even open source. Would there still be issues with "stealing art"?
