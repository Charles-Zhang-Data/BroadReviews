# Margin Call 2011

The logic and illustration makes no sense and is exaggeration and doesn't really reflect/explain how GFC works but the overall depiction is well orchestrated that even though the audience can not comprehend what's going on, the atmosphere seemed tense.

Also it reminds me how the number change really can mean big impact to downstream things.
