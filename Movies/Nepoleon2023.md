# Nepoleon 2023

Mediocore narrative, impressive final battle - not in terms of tactics, but just the depiction of battle field. Good introductory preview of the historical period and figure - however it requires contexts in order to understand what's going on because the movie itself skips many parts and backgroud material.

Depiction of peasants are better understood through A Plague Tale: Innocence.
