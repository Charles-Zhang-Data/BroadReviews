# BroadReviews

Conceptually part of My.All Text umbrealla. Extracted dedicatedly for TotalImagine.com exposure. Personal notes on broad spectrum general real world entities, categorized by experience type. Censored off personal details - those are available if ever necessary in Universai Diary (part of My.All).

This is data-only with no build actions and no direct Github pages setup, the contents are written in Marakdown expected to be compilable to HTML.

## TODO

- [ ] Reorganize and consolidate old review notes
- [ ] Language-adjustment and text formatting of yougner-time reviews
- [ ] Migrate all My.All Text reviews into this repo
